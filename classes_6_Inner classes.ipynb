    "## Inner classes\n",
    "\n",
    "An inner class or nested class is a defined entirely within the body of another class. If an object is created using a class, the object inside the root class can be used. A class can have more than one inner classes, but in general inner classes are avoided.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the most useful and powerful features of Python is its ability to nest classes within classes. A nested class is a class defined within another class, and inherits all the variables and methods of the parent class.\n",

    "### Inner class example\n",
    "\n",
    "Python has inner classes. Inner classes are classes that are defined inside other classes. Inner classes have access to all the members of their outer classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Indention is very important when using inner classes. Every inner class should be indented by 4 spaces.\n",
    "\n",
    "We create a class (Human) with one inner class (Head). An instance is created that calls a method in the inner class:"
